NAME
    AlfaDirectAPI - asynchronous thread-safe network API library, which tries
    to cover basic finance market functions of russian broker AlfaDirect
    (http://alfadirect.ru):
      - receives historical market quotes and stores them in DB
      - receives run-time market data
      - sends market order requests and receives responses

    This library is written in C++/Qt4 and uses ADAPI.dll (win32 black box dynamic
    library which kindly shared by AlfaDirect guys) to encode and decode network
    stream from broker server. On Unix ADAPI.dll is loaded by Wine, so all basic
    market data receiving functions work well, but trading won't work, because
    AlfaDirect uses CryptoPRO as crypto provider for order signing, and for now i
    have not found any working solution to sign market order successfully on Linux.

    AlfaDirectAPI is still in alpha, so even on Windows trading is broken (actually,
    order template must be correctly filled in, signed and sent to broker, and this
    is almost coded)
