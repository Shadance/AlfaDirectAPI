NAME
    AlfaDirectAPI - asynchronous thread-safe network API library, which tries
    to cover basic finance market functions of russian broker AlfaDirect
    (http://alfadirect.ru):
      - receives historical market quotes and stores them in DB
      - receives run-time market data
      - sends market order requests and receives responses

    This library is written in C++/Qt4 and uses ADAPI.dll (win32 black box dynamic
    library which kindly shared by AlfaDirect guys) to encode and decode network
    stream from broker server. On Unix ADAPI.dll is loaded by Wine, so all basic
    market data receiving functions work well. Trading is being worked only on
    Linux and Windows (on Windows native CryptoAPI is used for order signing,
    on Linux CryptoAPI ported by cryptopro is used [please, see src/ADCryptoAPI.cpp
    for details]).

    AlfaDirectAPI is still in alpha, so even on Linux and Windows trading is partially
    broken.
