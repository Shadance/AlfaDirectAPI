NAME
    AlfaDirectAPI - API library to Russian finance broker AlfaDirect
    http://alfadirect.ru

    This is a Qt wrapper over ADAPI.dll and heavy ugly AlfaDirect network
    protocol.

    AlfaDirectAPI is still in alpha, i.e. you can receive quotes but you can not
    place your trade orders (actually this will be developed ASAP).

    As I mentioned earlier this library uses ADAPI.dll (win32 black box dynamic
    library - public server API, which kindly shared by AlfaDirect guys), but
    you can still use it on Linux with Wine support.
